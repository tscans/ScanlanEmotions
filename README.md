This is my first major OpenCV program written in python. Aside from multiple small projects I've made, this is the most exciting application I've made so far. It is a bit messy but the program works pretty well. It works better than I think it would have if I had used machine learning algorithm given the time I spent to make it. In order to make it work you need cv2, numpy, and dlib. The file shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat may not have uploaded properly so make sure to download that from Matthew Earls repo before running this application. If you have any questions about my work feel free to email me at tscanlan@mchs.org.
